==========  INSTALLATION  ==========  


Suggested procedure to try out, for beta WaterColorBot units:

1. Install Inkscape ( http://inkscape.org ) 
2. Install the extensions as described above.  (For Windows, also install the UBW driver.)


3. Remove Velcro stowage straps from WCB frame, allowing carriage to move.
4. Remove WCB "Superstructure" from spoilboard (lower deck), allowing access to spoilboard.


5. Load spoilboard with three petri dishes, and fill each halfway with water.
6. Insert paint set into spoilboard, black at top, brown at bottom.
7. Clip paper onto spoilboard.
8. Replace WCB Superstructure, indexing it back into the spoilboard.


9. Move carriage, manually, to START corner, upper left of travel range.
10. Plug in WaterColorBot: Power and USB.


11. Open Inkscape.
12. Open WaterColorBot control extension in Inkscape.  Extensions menu > WaterColorBot > Control WaterColorBot

13. Adjust brush-up and brush-down positions as needed from Setup tab.  Select "Toggle brush up/down" option, and click apply to move the carriage between the two positions.  Adjust numeric values as necessary.

 Down position should leave brush holder nearly bottomed out in its range of travel. Up position should leave the bottom of the brush holder wood level with the flat top surface of the carriage, i.e., the surface that the servo motor rests upon.  The servo should not make angry noises at either extreme.

14. With brush holder in the "Down" position, insert the brush.  The ends of the bristles should barely touch the bottom of the petri dish.

14. Open an example file and try plotting, from the "Paint" tab.
